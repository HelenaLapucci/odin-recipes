<h2>Time to get hot...</h2>

<p>Italian Grandmas all over the country will light a candle to your cooking mastery</p>
<p>You might even get a girlfriend in the process, maybe, it's pasta, not magic you know...</p>
<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>A handfull of spaghetti</li>
    <li>1 bottle of tomato passata</li>
    <li>2 cloves of garlic</li>
    <li>1 medium sized onion</li>
    <li>butter to taste</li>
    <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    <li>Basil leaves and or grounded Basil</li>
    <li>Water, obviously.</li>
    <li>Optional: 1 finely diced carrot</li>
</ul>
<h2>Let's get cooking...</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Let's start by filling a deep pot with cold water, put a cover on it and put it on the fire, high heat</li>
    <li>While the water boils, dice your onion, garlic, and optional carrots as fine as you can</li>
    <li>Put a pan on at medium-high heat with a drizzle of olive oil</li>
    <li>When the pan is hot, drop the onions, garlic and carrot in it and sprinkle some salt and pepper on them</li>
    <li>Stir your flavours until the onions are slightly browned, then pour in your tomato passata </li>
    <li>Lower the heat to low-medium and after stirring it cover it up and allow it to gently boil for at least 30 minutes</li>
    <li>The longer you allow the sauce to boil, the better it will come out, just don't leave it more than 2 hours</li>
    <li>Towards the end of the sauce cooking time try it, if it's too acidic, add a pinch of sugar, if it's too savoury add butter</li>
    <li>At this point you can "Buttare la Pasta!" salt your now boiling water to taste and trow the spaghettis in</li>
    <li>Whatever cooking time the pasta bag says, do 1 minute less than that, unless you are in Italy, then follow the bag's instructions</li>
    <li>Try your pasta, don't trow it at a wall, just taste it like a normal person</li>
    <li>when you are satisfied with the texture, take out a small cup of pasta water, and put it to the side</li>
    <li>Strain your pasta, and shove it in the pan with the tomato sauce, mix it around and if your sauce is a bit too liquid, add some of that pasta water</li>
    <li>Grate some fresh parmesan on the top, and guarnish with 3-4 leafs of basil</li>

    <h2>Et Voila! a dinner fit for a true casanova, if you have leftovers (which I doubt), you can easily reheat it in a pan for 3 days afterwards!</h2>
    <h2><strong>All hail the Italians.</strong></h2>
