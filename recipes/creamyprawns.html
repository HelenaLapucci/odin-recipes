    <h2>Let's get Cooking...</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>First of all, if your prawns are frozen, let them sit in room temp water for half an hour</li>
        <li>While the prawns are defrosting, get a start on the rice, you can use a rice cooker, microwave packets or your prefered rice making method.</li>
        <li>Once the rice is cooking, dice your onions in thin strips and the garlic as small as you can</li>
        <li>Warm a pan and pour 2 tablespoons of olive oil in it, once hot, pour the onion and garlic in</li>
        <li>When the onions have taken a slight brown tint, salt them and trow the prawn in with the butter and some pepper</li>
        <li>Fry the prawns for not more than 5 minutes, then pour in your double cream and another sprinkle of salt and pepper</li>
        <li>On low heat, cook the prawns in the cream for around 10 minutes, or until the cream has tickened to perfection</li>
        <li>Your rice should be ready at this point, stir it around with a tablespoon of olive oil.</li>
        <li>Try your prawns, and if ready turn off the fire and leave them to rest for 5 minutes</li>
        <li>Serve the rice at the center of the plate, pour a generous ammount of sauce of the top and guarnish with optional garlic bread and or avocado slices</li>
