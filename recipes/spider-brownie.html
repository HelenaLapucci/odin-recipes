    <li>Mix the ingredients until your dough is compact and mouldable.</li>
    <li>Grab a spoonful of dough at the time and roll it into a small balls with your hands</li>
    <li>Lay the little balls on a tray covered in non stick baking paper</li>
    <li>Melt the chocolate slowly over a pot of boiling water, once melted, add the butter</li>
    <li>The glaze should be smooth and liquid, if it's too thick add your 30g of double cream</li>
    <li>Carefully coat the cake spheres in the glaze making sure to cover it completely</li>
    <li>Fill a deep bowl with chocolate sprinkles and roll the balls in it, place them back on the tray</li>
    <li>While the chocolate cover is still soft, place the silver candy where you want the eyes to be</li>
    <li>Place the tray in the fridge for at least an hour before applying the final decorations</li>
    <li>Unfold the liquorice wheels and create 160 little legs measuring about 6-7 cm each</li>
    <li>With a kebab stick or any pointy tool, make 8 hole in the sides of the spiders</li>
    <li>Place the legs in the holes, it might take a bit of patience, but in no time, you will have a small army of adorable (and delicious) <strong>Halloween Spiders!</strong></li>
